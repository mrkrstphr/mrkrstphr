### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kristopher Wilson

I'm a software developer working in Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA. I specialize in
making web-based business applications in Node JS, React, and GraphQL.

I once wrote a book about writing code in PHP following the Clean Architecture.
It's (uncreatively) called [Clean Architecture in PHP](https://leanpub.com/cleanphp).
